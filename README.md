### Hey! How ya doing?

Here you will mostly find my **research prototypes** and **side projects**, as I am not a full-fledged software developer, I do what most _hackers_ do - 
>combine stuff from everywhere to make one thing that works for me.

With the same spirit, usually i work with - 

Android Java SDK ▪️ Assembly x86_64 / ARM / 8086
▪️ Bash, BAT ▪️ BrainFu\*k
▪️ C ▪️ C++
▪️ CSS ▪️ Django
▪️ HTML ▪️ Java
▪️ JS ▪️ Perl
▪️ Python ▪️ Ruby
▪️ SQL ▪️ VBScript
▪️ Visual Basic .NET.


But I am not proficient in all of them, just these - **Assembly, C++, Python and Android java SDK.**
