Here you will mostly find my **research prototypes** and **side projects**.

Research Interests -
* Adaptive Cyber Defense Systems
* Nature/Bio-Inspired Cybersecurity
* Malware Analysis (x86_64 - Windows and Linux based platforms)
* Android-based system security (Application and System)
* Secure Coding / Programming


Usually, I work with **Assembly x86_64, C++, Python3** and **Android java SDK**. But can work with anything that relates to OOP or uses the familiar structure. (eg. Java, Ruby, C, Bash, Perl  etc.)
